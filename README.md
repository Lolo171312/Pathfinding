# Pathfinding
AI pathfinding in a grid using A*

In this project, I have created a path prediction on a grid using A* logic, ensuring it always finds the best path (a balance between total distance and total cost). Additionally, there are various grid cells with different movement costs. White cells have no cost, yellow cells have a medium cost, and red cells have a high cost. There are also black cells that cannot be walked on. You can place the starting point with the left click and the destination point with the right click
